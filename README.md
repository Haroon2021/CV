## Haroon Fatih

I am a Makers Software developer graduate with the goal of breaking into the tech industry. Prior to Makers I have over 8 years’ experience working in both consultancy and client-side with a wide range of transferable abilities including: problem-solving, analytical and quantitative skills. I am interested in technology because it opens up a world of possibilities; just think about the fact that there are over 198 million active websites in the world.
